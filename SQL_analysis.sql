-- Takeaway: The most important things to take away from the strategies we used in these exercises are that: 
-- (1) real data sets are messy and it is your job as an analyst to find that mess so that you can take it into account, 
-- (2) you can design your SQL queries to accommodate data anomalies, and 
-- (3) avoid using averages of averages to summarize the performance of a group.
